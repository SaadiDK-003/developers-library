â™¦ Stuff related to JQuery will be uploaded here...

### JQuery is a JavaScript Library that makes it easy for a developer to do more and write less.

#### You can visit `w3schools` to start learning it.
* [w3schools JQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp)

### Show Dialog element with the help of JQuery
```javascript
$.fn.extend({showModal: function() {
    return this.each(function() {
    if(this.tagName=== "DIALOG"){
            this.showModal();
        }
    });
}});
```
* need to add the above code before using it with JQuery else use the vanilla JS to perform it.
#### Example ~ Vanilla JS:
* let dialog = document.querySelector(`[your-selector-here]`);
* dialog.`showModal()`;
#### Example ~ JQuery
* $(`[your-selector-here]`).`showModal()`;
#### Because by default JQuery don't have `showModal()` function.
