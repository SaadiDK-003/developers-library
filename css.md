# CSS ~ Cascading Style Sheets

â™¦ Stuff related to CSS will be uploaded here...

#### To learn CSS I can help you with `two` websites and `two` YouTube channels you can follow along, these are the best sources that I personally recommended.

### Websites:

- [w3schools CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)

### YouTube Channels

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) ~ He is such a nice guy the way he teach CSS is so cool.
- [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified) ~ He is also a nice teacher he not only teach CSS but other front-end related stuff you can check on.
